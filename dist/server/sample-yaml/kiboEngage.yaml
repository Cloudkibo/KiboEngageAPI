#                              API Information                                 #

  title: KiboEngage API
  description: |
    Welcome to the KiboEngage API documentation! Our API provides flexible tools that can be used in the creation of new, outstanding projects.
    Please note that this documentation refers to the API 1.0 version. API 2.0 version is currently under construction and will be released soon.

    Build something great!

    ## Basic Usage
    All KiboEngage API requests start with `https://api.kiboengage.com/api/`

    The next segment of the URI path depends on the type of request. For example:

    `https://api.kiboengage.com/api/users/allagents`

    to get all agents data of a particular company.

    ## Authentication
    Each client will be given `kibo-app-id`, `kibo-app-secret` and `kibo-client-id`. Each KiboEngage client company will be give a company id by default. Company id is same as `kibo-client-id`. If a company wants to use this API, then it will enable the API in Company Settings and get `kibo-app-id` and `kibo-app-secret`.

    All these needs to be attached to the request headers to use the API. In the next version of the API, client applications will just need to authenticate once and get auth token. For the basic version, we need to attach these credentials in request headers each time we call API endpoints.

    ## Error Handling
    Errors are returned using standard HTTP error code syntax. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error (bad or missing parameters, not authenticated etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with KiboEngage’s servers. Any additional info is included in the body of the return call, JSON-formatted.

#      At this time, uploading via the API is not possible. We made a conscious
#      choice not to add this for the following reasons:
#
#      * Instagram is about your life on the go – we hope to encourage photos
#        from within the app.
#      * We want to fight spam & low quality photos. Once we allow uploading
#        from other sources, it's harder to control what comes into the Instagram
#        ecosystem. All this being said, we're working on ways to ensure users
#        have a consistent and high-quality experience on our platform.
